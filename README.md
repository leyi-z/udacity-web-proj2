### Database Info

The local database I used was named `db_proj2` with owner `leyi_psql` and no password. You might want to adjust the `models.py` file for the project to run on your computer. If you want to use the `trivia.psql` file to populate the database, make sure to change the owner in it.



### NPM Stuff

The `node_modules` file is needed to run the frontend, but I did not include it in the git repository since it's a huge file.
